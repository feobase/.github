Building high-performance, memory-safe, scalable, and 100% open-source alternatives to the most popular backend infrastructure tools. Whether serving one user or millions, we prioritize ease of use and scalability. Kubernetes is a first-class target, allowing you to scale on-premises or in the cloud.

We are done compromising. It’s a constant battle to find tools that check all the boxes. The JVM lacks performance, proprietary software is expensive, certain systems don’t scale, and C/C++ is unsafe. We are building a new ecosystem of tools that are high-performance, memory-safe, scalable, and 100% open-source.

## How we plan to achieve this

We are fully committed to two core technologies: **Rust** and **Kubernetes**. Rust serves as our primary language, offering systems-level performance along with strong guarantees around memory safety and type safety. Kubernetes is our primary deployment target, offering a highly scalable and vendor-agnostic solution for deploying and managing these systems.
