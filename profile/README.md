# FeOBase

Building high-performance, memory-safe, 100% open-source alternatives to the most popular dev tools. Whether serving one user or one million, we prioritize ease of use and scalability. Kubernetes is a first class target allowing you to scale on prem or in the cloud.

We are done comprimizing. It's a constant battle of trying to find tools that check all the boxes. The JVM lacks performance, proprietary software is expensive, and C/C++ is unsafe. We are building a new ecosystem of tools that are high-performance, memory-safe, and 100% open-source.
